# Always use bun for package management and script execution

- Use `bun` instead of `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` for all package management operations
- Use `bun run` for executing scripts defined in package.json
- Use `bun install` for installing dependencies
- Use `bun add` for adding new dependencies
- Use `bun remove` for removing dependencies
- Use `bun test` for running tests
- Use `bun build` for building the project
- Use `bun dev` for development mode
- Use `bun run` followed by the script name for any custom scripts
