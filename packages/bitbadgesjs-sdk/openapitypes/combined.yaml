        This defines the options for fetching additional account details.


        A view is a way of fetching additional details about an account, and
        these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.


        Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
        supplied to get the next page.


        We support the following views:

        - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the account.

        - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
        account.

        - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the account.

        - `badgesCollected` - Fetches the badges collected by the account
        sequentially in random order.

        Defines the options for fetching additional collection details.


        A view is a way of fetching additional details about a collection, and
        these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.

        Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
        supplied to get the next page.

        If the bookmark is not supplied, the first page will be returned.


        We support the following views:

        - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the collection.

        - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
        collection.

        - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the collection.

        - `owners` - Fetches the owners of the collection sequentially in random
        order.

        - `merkleChallenges` - Fetches the merkle challenges for the collection
        in random order.

        - `approvalTrackers` - Fetches the approvals trackers for the collection
        in random order.

      description: >-
        NumberType is a type that can be used to represent a number in
        JavaScript in multiple ways.

        Because the blockchain supports numbers > 2^53, we need to use BigInts
        or strings to represent them.


        NumberType is a union of all the types that can be used to represent a
        number in JavaScript.

      anyOf:
        - type: number
        - type: string

        JSPrimitiveNumberType is a union of all the types that can be used to
        represent a number in JavaScript.

        This is the same as NumberType, but without BigInts because they are not
        a primitive.
