 * UserBalanceStore is the store for the user balances for a collection.

 * It consists of a list of balances, a list of approved outgoing transfers, and a list of approved incoming transfers,
 * as well as the permissions for updating the approved incoming/outgoing transfers.
 *
 * Upon initialization, all fields (minus the balances) are set to the defaults specified by the collection.
 *
 * The outgoing transfers can be used to allow / disallow transfers which are sent from this user.
 * If a transfer has no match, then it is disallowed by default, unless from == initiatedBy (i.e. initiated by this user)
 * and autoApproveSelfInitiatedOutgoingTransfers is set to true.
 *
 * The incoming transfers can be used to allow / disallow transfers which are sent to this user.
 * If a transfer has no match, then it is disallowed by default, unless to == initiatedBy (i.e. initiated by this user)
 * and autoApproveSelfInitiatedIncomingTransfers is set to true.
 *
 * Note that the user approved transfers are only checked if the collection approved transfers do not specify to override
 * the user approved transfers. 
 *
 * The permissions are used to determine whether the user can update the approved incoming/outgoing transfers and auto approvals.
